```

### 2. **Start Ollama**
```bash
brew services start ollama  # macOS
# or
ollama serve               # Any platform
```

### 3. **Install Python Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Install AI Models** (Optional - will auto-download when needed)
```bash
python setup_ollama.py
```

### 5. **Launch the App**

**Desktop GUI (Recommended):**
```bash
python gui_app.py
# or on macOS/Linux
./start_gui.sh
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📦 **Model Installation**

The app will automatically download models as needed, but you can pre-install them:

### **Comprehensive Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install the best specialized models for each task
python setup_comprehensive_models.py
```

This script will:
- Show you which models are recommended for each task type
- Let you choose installation priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Calculate total download size
- Install models with progress tracking

### **Manual Installation**
```bash
# Install all recommended models
python setup_ollama.py

# Or install individually
ollama pull llama3
ollama pull codellama
ollama pull wizard-math
ollama pull phi3
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull mixtral
ollama pull llava
```

### **Installation Options**

**🔥 High Priority (Essential - ~17GB total):**
- `codellama` - Code generation
- `llama3` - Text generation & dialogue
- `wizard-math` - Mathematical reasoning
- `mistral` - Question answering

**⚡ Medium Priority (Enhanced - +12GB):**
- `phi3` - Commonsense & sentiment analysis
- `llava` - Visual question answering

**💡 Low Priority (Advanced - +30GB):**
- `mixtral` - Advanced summarization

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Desktop GUI**
1. Launch: `python gui_app.py` (or `./start_gui.sh` on macOS/Linux)
2. Type your query in the input box
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. Watch the AI route your query to the best model
5. See which model was used in the response

### **Command Line**
```bash
python main.py

You: Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
🤖 [Response from codellama]

You: Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 13
🤖 [Response from wizard-math]

You: What is the capital of France?
🤖 [Response from llama3]
```

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Models Mapping**
Edit `models_mapping.txt` to customize which models handle which tasks:

```
{coding_generation: codellama,
text_generation: llama3,
mathematical_reasoning: wizard-math,
...}
```

### **Adding New Models**
1. Install the model: `ollama pull your-model`
2. Add to `models_mapping.txt`
3. Restart the app
